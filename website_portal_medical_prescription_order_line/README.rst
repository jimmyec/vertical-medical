Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

* Medicaments that are not in any pricelists cannot be added to the cart. Make 
  sure to at least select ``Specific prices per customer segment, currency, 
  etc.`` under ``Pricing`` in ``Sales > Settings``. Then add your medicament 
  to a pricelist so it can be added to the cart when the pricelist is active.
